                <h4>Shocking FOIA request delays</h4>
                Data of completed from over 13,000 FOIA requests made to US Agencies across the country, show that some
                agencies are taking as long as 9 years to complete legal requests submitted to those agencies. Analysis
                of requests submitted between 2018 to 2022 shows that out of some 39,100 over the period show 13,000
                were completed, but not all completions were in good time, with some taking as long at 9 years.

                Demonstration of a responsive web development with scrollytelly, using China's aforestation record. China converted about 8million hectares of forest cover over a 30 year period, making it the country with the largest percentage of forest expansions despite globally. Chinaâ€™s success in expanding its forests is attributable to polices implemented since 1990 that have seen the planting of over 4million hectares of forest every year, through 6 national forestry programs

                July to a low of 226 ghc per 100 tubers of yams, which translates averagely to a drop from 10ghc per
